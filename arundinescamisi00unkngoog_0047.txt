32 ARUNDJNESOAMJ.'

He thought Ι was o ghost, mother, for I was all in white 3

And I rem by him without speaking, like a flosh of light

They eall me oruel-hearted, but I care not what they say,

For I’m to be Queen o' the Moy, mother, I’m to be Queen
o' the May.

They say he's dying all for love, but thet oen never be:

They sayhis heart is breaking, mother-what is that tome?

There'e many a holder led ’ill woo me any summerday ς

And I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I’m to be Queen
o’ the May.

Little Effie shall go with me tomorrow to the green,
And you’ll be there too, mother, to see me made the Queen3
For the shepherd-lads on every eide 'ill come from fer owoy3

And I’m to be Queen o’ the Moy, mother, I’m to be Queen
o' the Moy.

The honey-ouokle round the poreh hes woven ite wavy

And hhhhrg'meadow-trenehes blow the faint eweet ouokoo

And {mh moreh-marigold shines like fire in swemps end

hollows gray 3
And I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen

0’ the Moy.
