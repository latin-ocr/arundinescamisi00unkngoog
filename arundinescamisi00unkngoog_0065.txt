⁵ 11 §nemetim

Lo as a dove when up she spnngs,
To benr thro‘ Heaven a tale of woe,

Some dolorous messege knit below
The wild pulsation of her wings 3

Like her I 30, Ι cannot stay 3

I leave this morte] ank behind,

A weight of nerves without a mind,
And leave the eliffs, end haste away

O'er ocean-mirrors rounded large,
And reenh the glow of southern skies,

And see the seils et distance nise,
And linger weeping on the merge,

And saying: ι(1011111111111111, 111γίτί111111
Ι1 this the end of all my eere't'
And circle meaning in the air,

ίΙ111111 the end? Is this the endt'

And forwnnd dm egen'n, and play
About the prow, end beck return ⁴
To where the body site, and lemn

Thae I have been 111 hour away.

Temnon.
