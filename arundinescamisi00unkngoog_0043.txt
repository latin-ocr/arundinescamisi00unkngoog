ARUNDINES OAMJ.

1111111111 1111111 Mne.

WHEN first, belwed, in vanished heure,
The Blind Men sought ὼγ hand 1ο gain,
They said thy cheek was bright ae flowers
New freshened by the summer’s rein.
The beauty, which made them rejoiee,
My derkened eyes might never see,

But well Ι knew ὼγ gentle voice,
And that was all in ah 1ο me.

At length, es years rolled swistly 011,
They talked 1ο me of Time'e decey,
Of roses from ὼγ eost eheek gone,
Of ebon treeses turned 1ο gray.
I heard them ; but I heeded not;
The withering change I could not see ;
Thy voice still eheered my darkened lot,
And that wae ah in all 1ο me.

And still, beloved, 1111 life grows cold,
We'll wender 'neath the genial sky,
And only know that we ere old
By eounhing happy houm gone by.
Thy eheek may lose ies blushing hue,

Thy brow less beautiful may be3
But oh! the voice, which first I knew,
still keeps the seme sweet tone 1ο me!

MRs. NORTON.
