obe May &otoo

Yon muso mind and call me early, call me early, Mothor
deor

Tomorrow'll be the happiest time of all the glad Now-year5

Of all the glad Now-year, mother, tho maddest morriost day,

For I'm to be Quoon o’ the May, mother, I'm to be Queen
o’ tho May.

There's many a blaok blaok eye, they say, but nono oo
bright as mine ;

There’s Margaret and Mary‚ there’s Kato and Carolin03

But none so fair as little Aliae in all tho land, thoy say 3

For I’m to be Quoen 0’ the May, mother, rm oo bo Quoen
o' tho May.

I sloep so sound all night, mother, thot I shall never wake,
If you do not call mo loud, when the day begins to break 3
But I must gothor knots of flowers and buds and garlands

gay,

For I’m to be Queen o’ the Moy, mother, I'm to be Quoen
o’ ohe May. ¹

Ao I camo up the valley, whom think ye should I soe,

But Robe1²o leaning on tho bridgo beneath tho hamel-troo?

He thougho of that sharp look, mother, Ι gave him yester-
da :

But Pu} to be Quoon o' tho May, mother, I'm to bo Quoon
o’ the May.
