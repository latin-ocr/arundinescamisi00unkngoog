The swimming vapour slopee athwnrt the glou,
Pute 101111 111 arm, and ereeps 110111 pine 10 piae,
And loiters, slowly drawn. On either hand ,
The 1111111 and mendow-ledges midway down
Hang rich in flowem, end 111 below them roars
The long brook falh'ng thno' the elov’n ravine ‘

of Parin, enee her playmate 011 the hille.
Her cheek had 1011 the rose, and round her neck
Flented her 11111, 01 seemed 10 fleat, in 1111
She, leaning 011 1 fragment twined with vine,
Sang 10 the 1111111111, till 1111 mountain shade
Sloped downwand 10 her 1011110111 the upper elifl:

“O mother, Ida, many-fountejn’d Ide,
Dear 1101111111, heerken ere I die!
For 11011111 noonday quiet holds 1111 hill:
The graeshopper is silent in the grass:
The lizard, with her shadow 011 the stone,
