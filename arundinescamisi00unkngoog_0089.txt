AR UNDINES olm.

So that my vigour, wedded to thy blood,
Shall etlike within thy pulses like a (tod’s,
To puoh thee forwurd thro’ alife of shoeks,

Dangers, and deeds, until endurunoe grow

’ Sinew'd with aetion, and the fullgrown will,

Oireled thro‘ all experienees, puro lew,
Oommeasure perfect freedom.‘

“Here she oeased,
And Puris ponder'd, and Ι oried, ‘O Pario,
Give it to Pullus l' but he heard me not,
Or hearing would not hear me, woe is me! ¹

“O mother Ida, many fountain'd Idn,
Dear mother Ida, heerken ere I die!
Idalion Aphrodite beautiful,
Fresh us the soum, new-beth’d in Paphien wells,
With rosy slender fingere baohwmd drew
From her worm brows and bosom her deep hair
Ambrosial‚ golden round her lueid throat
And shoulder: from the violets her light foot
Shone rosy-white, und o’er her rounded form,
Between the shadows of the vinebunohes,
Floated the glowing eunlight, ao she moved

“Dear mother Ida, heerken ere I die!
She, with u subtle smile in her mild eye,
The herald of her triumph, drawing vhigh,
Half-whisper’d in hie eur, ‘I promise thee
The fuirest and most loving wife in Greeee'
