ARUNDINES OAMI.

“Deer mother Ida, hearken ere Ι dle!
She oeaeed: and Paris held the oootly fruit
Ouo ot erm’s length, eo much the thought of power
Fletter'd hle spirit ; but Pellae-where she stood
Somewhet opert, her clear end bared limbo
O'erthwerted with the brezen-heeded spear,
Upon her peerly shoulder leening oold,
The while, above, her full and earnest eye , ’
Over her snoweold breoot and engry oheek
Kept welch, waiting deoision, mode reply:
‘Self-reverenoe, sels-knowledge, sels-control,
These three alone leod life 'oo sovereign power.
Yet not for power (power of herself
Would come unoell’d lor), bul to live by law,
Acting the law we live by without sear ,¹
And, beoeuse right is right, to follow n'ght
Were wisdom in the soorn of consequenoe’

“Deer molher Ide, heerken ore I die!
Again she said: ‘I woo thee not with gista
Sequel of guerdon could not alter me '
Το falrer. Judge thou me by what Ι em,

So shall thou find me fairesl Yet, indeed,

If, gazing on divinity disrobed‚

Thy mom] eyes are frell to judge of fair,
Unbiass’d with sels-profit, ohl rest thee suro
Theo Ι shall love thee well end oleove to theo,
