§aare aton. Ι

Tnn Moon had climbed the highest hill,
Which rises 0'er the source of Dee,
And from the eastern summit shed ·

Her silvery light e'er tower and tree;

When Mary laid her down to sleep,

Her thoughts 0n Sandy far at sea
When low and soft a voice she heard
Say, ιΜωγ, weep no more for me’

She from her pillow gently raised
Her head, to see who there might be;
She saw young Sandy shivering stand,
With visage pale and hollow e'e

‘0 maiden dear, eold is my clay,
‘It lies beneath a stormy sea 3

‘Fan far from thee I sleep in death,
‘So Mary,—weep no more for me.

ιΟ Maiden dear, thyself prepare 3
‘We soon shall meet upon that shore,
‘Where love is free from doubt and aare,
‘And we shall meet to part no more'

Loud crowed the cock3 the Shadow fied ;
No more of Sandy could she see 3
But soft the parting Spirit said,
‘Sweet May, weep no more for me’
