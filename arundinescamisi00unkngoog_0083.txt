ARUNDINES cam.

When all the full-faced presence of the Gods
Ranged in the halls of Peleus: whereupon
Rose feud, with question unto whom ’twere due:
But light-scot Iris brought it yesterere,
Delivering that to me, by common voice
Elected umpire, Here comes today,

Pallas and Aphrodite, claiming each

This mced of fairest. Thou, within the cave
Behind yon whispering tuft ol oldest pino,
May’st well behold them unbeheld unheard
Hear all, and see thy Paris judge of Gods!

“Dcar mother Ida. hcarken ere I diel
It was the deep midnoon: one silvery cloud
Had lost his way between the piney sides
Of this long glen. Thon to the bower they came ;
Naked they came to that smooth-swarded bower,
And at their feet the crocus brake like fire,
Violet, amaracus, and asphodel,
Lotos, and lilies: and a wind arose,

And overhead the wandering ivy and vine,
This way and that, in ma'ny a wild festoon

Ran riot, garlanding the guarled boughs
With bunch and berry and flower thro' and.thro’.

“O mother Ida hearken ere Ι die!
On the trec-tops a crested peacock lit,
And o'er him flow’d a golden cloud, and lean'd

Upon him, slowly dropping fragrant ders.
