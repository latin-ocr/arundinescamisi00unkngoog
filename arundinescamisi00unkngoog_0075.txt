ARUNDINBS OAMJ.

⁵ {in inmunem.

Lo ae a dove when up ehe springs,
Το bear thro' Henven a tale of woe,

Some dolorous meneage knit below
The wild pulsation of her winge3

Like her I go, Ι cannot stay 3

I leave thie mortui erk behind,

A weight of nerves without a mind,
And leave the eliffe, end haste away

O'er ocean-minore rounded large,
And reaeh the glow of southern ekiee,

And see the suile ab distance rise,
And linger weeping on the merge,

And seying: ‘Comes he thus, my fiiendi
Is this the end of all my cerei’
And circle meaning in the air,

‘Ie this the endi Ie this the endi'

And forwnrd dart again, end play
About the pron, and beck return
Το where the bodyeite, end lemn

That I have been nn hour away.

Temnon.
