All the valley, mother, 'ill be fresh, ond green, end still,

And the oowelip and the orowfoot are over ah the hill,

And the rivulet in the flowery delo 'ill merrily glauce end

Of allthe glad N ew-yeor, mother, the mnddest merriest day,
For I'm to be Queen o’ the May, mother, I'm to be Queen

Twmffl, twinkle, little Star5
How I wonder what you are!
Up above the world eo high,
Like a diomond in the sky.
When the blozing Sun is gone,
When he nothing shines upon,
