1111 to 11111111. ’

Dauenrnss of Jove, 1111111111 power,
Thou tamer of the human breast„

Whose iron scourge, and torturing honr
The bad affn‘ght, affiiot the best!

Bound in thy adamantine 1111111,
The proud are taught to 11111 of pain,

And purple tyrnnte vainly grean
With pange unselt before, unpitied and alone.

When first thy Sire to send on earth
Vnone, his derling child, designed,
To thee he gave the heavenly binah,
And bade to form 1111 infant mind.
stem rugged Nurse! thy rigid lore

With patience many a year she bore;
What sorrow was, thou bad'st her know,

And from her own she learned to melt at others'
woe.
